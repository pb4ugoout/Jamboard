# Jamboard

This repo will serve as a singular location to share details on the hardware that is a Google Jamboard. Google has set an EoL date of 10/1/2024 following the automatic update expiration on 9/30/2024. Googles remote cloud services will EoL on 12/31/2024.

As of 10/1/2024, any working Jamboards will be put into unlicensed mode. The device will effectively become an offline digital whiteboard with no access to any remote Google services at all.

The goal of this repo is to provide useful information for anyone seeking to assist in the development of a Lineage OS build to run on the device to make it more useful after Google kills it.
