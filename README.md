# Jamboard

This repo will serve as a singular location to share details on the hardware that is a Google Jamboard. Google has set an EoL date of 10/1/2024 following the automatic update expiration on 9/30/2024. Googles remote cloud services will EoL on 12/31/2024.

As of 10/1/2024, any working Jamboards will be put into unlicensed mode. The device will effectively become an offline digital whiteboard with no access to any remote Google services at all.

The goal of this repo is to provide useful information for anyone seeking to assist in the development of a Lineage OS build to run on the device to make it more useful after Google kills it.

As of 10/31, all Jamboard licenses have been revoked within the Google Enterprise Console. 

We discovered that the final EoL update for the Jamboard will allow for a full vanilla Android experience. While fully undocumented by Google, as far as I'm able to find, you can connect a keyboard to the unit and hit Win + N to pull down the notifications panel. From there you can access the complete Android settings menu. This allows for access to the browser, the play store, developer mode, etc... You can install a different launcher and disable the kiosk launcher to turn the unit into a giant Android tablet.
