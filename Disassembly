The Jamboard is a fairly difficult device to gain access to. The back panel consist 3 pieces of plastic. There's a small deco cover, a large deco cover, and a large inner panel. 

The small deco cover is held on with magnets and can be easily pulled from the larger outer panel.

The outer deco is held to the inner panel with many small but tough clips around the perimeter of the unit. These clips are holding the outer panel to the inner panel. There are 11 clips on the top, 8 on each side, and 6 on the bottom. You'll need something very tough to get into the seam around the display and pry at the clips. Take care to pry at the outer panel only. It's very easy to get behind the rear panel which cannot be removed this way and will break if you use too much force. I'm not sure if it's possible to do this without causing damage to the outer panel and/or the clips. It's all held together VERY tightly. In addition to these outer clips, there are 10 large/wide clips around the middle cutout where the small deco panel is located. These clips are much more easily released but still present a challenge to be aware of. 

Once you get all the clips removed, be aware that the button panel (power, input, volume) is screwed to the back of the outer panel. You'll need to unscrew the panel or disconnect the cable before pulling the outer panel too far from the unit.

The inner panel is held to the unit with 40 screws of several types. Around the perimeter and across the back are 32 metric machine screws. There are 2 small plastic thread screw on the lower right where the input connections are. Of the last 4, unlabeled screws, two of them are behind the small deco cover and the other two are just below the cutout for the deco cover. Once all of the screws are removed, the inner panel will come away without any force at all. It is only held on with screws.

The internals are relatively simple consisting of power, input, and output. It looks far more complex than it is.

The two beige PCBs are power supplies. The larger one is the main supply for all of the components in the unit. The larger supply feeds the smaller supply via a 14-pin single stack connector. The smaller supply is dedicated to the backlight of the display panel.

Along each edge there is a small PCB connected to three shielded ribbon cables. The inner cables are connected to the lowest visible PCB. The outer cables are connected to the outer glass over the LCD panel. That PCB is connected to the PCB just to the right that is covered by the aluminum heat sink. These 6 PCBs are the Raspt touch control system. They are enabling the touchscreen and pen functionality on the display. I believe the board under the heat sink is the main processor, while the board to the left is just the interposer for the 4 boards along the perimeter. The interposer is connected to the controller via a 4-pin cable for data (it appears to be USB) and a power cable. The main controller is connected to the carrier board with the via a power connection and a similar USB data cable that is also broken out into another connector with more wires. I'm not certain what this is but it could be power signaling based on other observations around the unit.

The large board in the middle right is the main control unit for the whole display. Fundamentally, this is a large carrier board for a standalone nVidia Jetson TX1 SoC module. The Jetson module can be see as the aluminum rectange in the upper left of the carrier. Prior to removal by me, the TX1 had a large heatsink installed. There was copious thermal compound between the SoC and a full cover aluminum plate. Two 8mm heat pipes are connecting the plate to the large heat sink. There are lots of connections to and from this board along with some unused connections both visible and hidden under the shield. There are two small momentary switches on the board as well. One of these is system reset button. I'm not sure what is under the large heat sink as it's screwed in from the opposite side of the carrier and I haven't yet removed it. The photos are shown with the shield removed. Under the shield is an additional HDMI port that is not accessible with the shield installed. The purpose is as of yet unknown. There are 2 white 4-pin headers that are also unused with an unknown purpose at this time. I'm hopeful that one of them is UART.

Extended details of the carrier board are a work in progress and are documented here:

The board on the right is for IO. It's taking in data from the USB type-c and type-a ports as well as video in from the USB type-c and the HDMI port. It's also able to send touch input data to a connected device via the USB type-c port. This allows the screen to act as a large touchscreen display for a connected computer. There are several premade patch cables connecting this board to the carrier board along with one exception. The topmost connector is of the same type as the unknown connection on the touch screen interposer. I want to assume it's power since the board has no other connections that could be fulfilling that purpose. Next is a USB 3.0 Type-A cable. This cable is a USB 3.0 Type-A to Type-C cable that runs up to the camera at the top of the unit. Under that is a USB 3.0 micro-b cable. Next is a Displayport cable and lastly, at the bottom, is an HDMI cable.

In the bottom middle is an additional IO interface. It's visible through all 3 rear panel covers. It's similar to the side IO board but it contains the main IEC power input connection, gigabit ethernet, a TOSLINK optical audio output, an additional HDMI input, and a micro-b USB port. This USB port is connected directly to the carrier board and serves as the recovery port connected directly to the Jetson module.

The last PCB is small and for the button panel. There are 4 buttons. Power, Volume Up, Volume Down, and Input. Although, I believe the Vol buttons function as display brightness when using the external HDMI inputs. Not sure why that's the case. More testing is needed. The most relevant detail here is that the "VOL Up" button doubles as the force recovery button. Using continuity on a multimeter, I traced this button all the way back to pin E1 on the 400-pin Samtec header for the Jetson module.
